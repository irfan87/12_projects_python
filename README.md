## About 12 Projects Python

This project contains 12 Python projects. Starting with the simple application to advance for beginners. This project is not about writing the code, but as a refresher (like me) on how the code works and think like a programmer.

The code examples have been structured as below:

- `01_project`
  - contains `example.py` and `madlibs.py` that I followed from the tutorials and `sample_madlibs` folder contains the code that I wrote by my own.
